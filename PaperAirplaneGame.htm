	<p1><b>How To Play</b>
	   <br>
	   <br>Steer the paper airplane down the obstacle for
	   <br>as long as you can. The further down you reach,
	   <br>the more points you will get. The quickest time
	   <br>to get the most points is also recorded.
	   <br>
	   <br>Every 50 points you get results in ascending to the
	   <br>next level. Every level increase means the horizontal
	   <br>walls get longer, thus requiring you to make steeper
	   <br>turns to get through.
	   <br>
	   <br>Note that the more downward the paper airplane faces,
	   <br>the faster it falls. This can be used to get points
	   <br>quicker, but it's harder to control the plane in such
	   <br>a way.

	<p2><b>Controls</b>
	   <br>
	   <br>Left Key  - Steers the paper airplane to the left of
	   <br>            the screen. It is preferable to hold the key
	   <br>            for steering.
	   <br>
	   <br>Right Key - Steers the paper airplane to the right of
	   <br>            the screen. It is preferable to hold the key
	   <br>            for steering.
	   <br>
	   <br>
	</p1>
	<p3><b>Other Notes</b>
 	   <br>
	   <br>You can turn the music off/on with the "On/Off" button on
	   <br>the bottom-right of the game screen. This doesn't affect sound
	   <br>effects, though.
